> Note: This project can only be compiled with Visual C++ 2019 (C++17) for the time being, and it is not guaranteed to support compilers such as `gcc` and `clang`. But we will try to keep this project compatible with gcc and clang during the development process. If you don't have Visual C++ 2019 (not Visual Studio code), please visit [here](https://www.visualstudio.com) to download, and check the content related to C++ when installing.

> Note: We are also maintaining [another code repository](https://github.com/vistart/CubicCrossLinkedOctree), which is used to adapt the `gcc` and `clang` compilers under the Linux operating system. If you cannot use Visual Studio, or the compilation target is Linux operating system, you can try this code repository.
